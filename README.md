# neural-network-tricks-tarneeb

## Objective of the project
Tarneeb and Tricks are very known cards games in the middle-east.
The aim of this project is to develop and train a neural networks to play Tarneeb and Tricks using active and reinforcement learning.

The project is writen in Python and uses principally Keras library.

As Tarneeb is the more simple, we will start with it, and tricks will be added in a later time.

## What is Tarneeb-41?
Tarneeb exists mainly in two versions (41 and 61), we are interrested in the 41 version as it is more popular. So in this document when we talk about Tarneeb, we mean Tarneeb-41.
